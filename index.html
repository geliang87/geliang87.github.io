    <h1>Welcome to Liang's site.</h1>
    <p>
    	I'm an audio engineer. I'm involved in many audio/acoustic algorithms for sound recognition and source localization. I have developed audio signal processing applications on FPGA, DSP, MSP430, and ARM borads.

    	I'm also passionate about music. I'm currently developing an iOS application for enhancing piano practising with the help of live music detection. Check it out soon.
