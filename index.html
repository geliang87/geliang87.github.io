    <h1>Welcome to Liang's site.</h1>
    <p>
    	I'm an audio engineer. I'm involved in many audio/acoustic algorithms for sound recognition and source localization. I have developed audio signal processing applications on FPGA, DSP, MSP430, and ARM borads.

    <p>
    	I'm also passionate about music. I'm currently developing an iOS application for enhancing piano practising with the help of live music detection. Check it out soon.
